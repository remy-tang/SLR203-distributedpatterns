# SLR203 Patterns

In this project, we implement various patterns related to actor model algorithms for the distributed systems course.

Implemented patterns: 
- 1 : Create reference by construction
- 2 : Create reference by message
- 3 : Fire and forget untyped abstract actor
- 4 : Fire and forget abstract actor
- 5 : Message immutability problem
- 6 : Tell to and forget
- 7 : Request and do not wait for response
- 8 : Request, block, and wait for response
- 9 : Respond to
- 10 : Broadcast round robin
- 11 : Converge cast
- 12 : Publisher/Subscriber
- 19 : Communication topology
- 20 : Uncontrolled flood
- 21 : Controlled flood
- 22 : Shortest length flood
